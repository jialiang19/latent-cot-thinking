# Do Latent-CoT Models Think Step-by-Step?
### A Mechanistic Study on Sequential Reasoning Tasks

This is the official repository for the paper: **"Do Latent-CoT Models Think Step-by-Step? A Mechanistic Study on Sequential Reasoning Tasks"**.

This work investigates the internal reasoning mechanisms of Latent Chain-of-Thought models using mechanistic interpretability techniques (Logit Lens, Patching, and Probing) on sequential reasoning tasks.

## 🚧 Status
Code release is in progress. The full source code, datasets, and reproduction scripts will be available here shortly.
